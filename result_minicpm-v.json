In this case, all four squares show \"Ff\" as the offspring's genotype for fur color. Since there are no other genotypes shown (e.g., ff), we can assume that only one allele controls the trait and it must be dominant to result in a visible phenotype of brown fur. Therefore, if F represents the dominant allele for brown fur, then all four squares indicate heterozygous offspring with \"Ff\" genotype which would express the brown fur trait. Thus, the probability is 4 out of 4 or 100%. However, since we are likely to choose from a set of discrete probabilities and given options do not include '1', it seems there might be an error in interpretation as all offspring will have brown fur according to this Punnett square setup.",
